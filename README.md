# Ionic-Angular-Crud
Phone app with Ionic and java Swing

Start the frontend with "ionic serve --lab" it's made for mobile phones.


# CRUD Options
The table has diferent options, I will explain a little what they do:

add: Opens the add form to introduce the values you want to add.

update: With this you can manually update the table, normally it isn't needed but just in case.

delete: Erases the values of the selected row.

mofidy: Opens the modify form with the values of the row.


# Form restrictions
The forms checks if you introduced a valid name, with a min length of 3, and if the price is a number, it accepts decimals it also adds the dollar symbol.


# Slider
Finally as an extra I added a slider: 

-Which moves itself automatically. 

-When you slide it manually after you stop doing it continues to auto slide. 

-If you go to other page and come back it starts to slide again. 


This took many functions to make it work.
